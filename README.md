=================

Allocates chores reasonably fairly and sends emails. I recommend forking this project (and issuing pull requests!) if you have housemates. Get Windows task scheduler / cron to run the script eg weekly.

To do:
× Send emails.
× Scrape eg a lottery website for public random numbers so that tenants know the script wasn't just run repeatedly until a good result occurred.
